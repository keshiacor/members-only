# README

Members Only - an exclusive clubhouse from the Odin Project.

## Description

This is part of the Odin project Rails curriculum to focus on using Devise for authentication. In this project, users create an account, login and see posts. The members can see posts from other members but non-members cannot identify who the author of a post is (i.e posts will be anonymous to non-members).

more details to be added here later...
